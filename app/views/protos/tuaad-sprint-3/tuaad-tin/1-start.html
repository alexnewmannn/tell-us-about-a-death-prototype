      <p class="lede">When someone dies, you can let most government organisations
        know in one go.</p>
      <p>As soon as you can, you'll need to give some details about the person
        who died. This information will be passed on to the following organisations:</p>
        <ul class="list list-bullet">
          <li>HM Revenue and Customs - to deal with any taxes and benefits</li>
          <li>Department for Work and Pensions - to deal with any benefits and
            State Pension</li>
          <li>Passport Office - to cancel a British passport</li>
          <li>Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency - to cancel a driving licence</li>
          <li>the local council - to deal with Council Tax, any Blue Badge, any
            Housing Benefit, inform council housing services and remove the person
          from the electoral register</li>
        </ul>
      <h2 class="heading-medium">Before you start</h2>
      <p>You'll need:</p>
      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>the National Insurance number of the person who died</li>
        <li>their name</li>
        <li>your National Insurance number</li>
      </ul>
