      <p>As soon as you can, you'll need to give some details about the person who died. This information will be
        passed on to the following organisations:</p>

            <li>Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency &ndash; to cancel a driving licence</li>
            <li>the local council &ndash; to deal with Council Tax, any Blue Badge, any
              Housing Benefit, inform council housing services and remove the person
            from the electoral register</li>
          </ul>
